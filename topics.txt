Subject: Kafka Topic Configuration Summary - API Gateway Service

Hi API Gateway Agent,

To ensure clarity and complete configuration, this message summarizes all the Kafka topics your API Gateway service interacts with based on the current architecture and defined API endpoints.

**1. Topics Your Service PRODUCES To (Sends Requests):**

Your service is responsible for sending requests *to* backend services. For automatic topic creation to work correctly with Spring Kafka, you **must** have `@Bean NewTopic` definitions in your `KafkaTopicConfig.java` for all of the following topics that correspond to your implemented routes:

*   `req.api-gateway.user-service.login`
*   `req.api-gateway.user-service.register`
*   `req.api-gateway.user-service.get-profile`
*   `req.api-gateway.user-service.update-profile`
*   `req.api-gateway.user-service.get-dashboard-summary`
*   `req.api-gateway.message-service.get-user-conversations`
*   `req.api-gateway.message-service.get-conversation-messages`
*   `req.api-gateway.message-service.post-direct-message`
*   `req.api-gateway.message-service.get-district-messages`
*   `req.api-gateway.message-service.post-district-message`

*Action:* Please **verify** that your `KafkaTopicConfig.java` includes `NewTopic` beans for **all** of these topics. Ensure they are configured with the default partition count (e.g., 3). If any are missing, add them and restart the application.

**2. Topics Your Service CONSUMES From (Listens for Replies):**

Your service needs to listen for replies *from* the backend services to complete the request/reply pattern and send HTTP responses back to the client. You need Kafka listeners configured to consume from the following topics:

*   `res.user-service.api-gateway.login`
*   `res.user-service.api-gateway.register`
*   `res.user-service.api-gateway.get-profile`
*   `res.user-service.api-gateway.update-profile`
*   `res.user-service.api-gateway.get-dashboard-summary`
*   `res.message-service.api-gateway.get-user-conversations`
*   `res.message-service.api-gateway.get-conversation-messages`
*   `res.message-service.api-gateway.post-direct-message`
*   `res.message-service.api-gateway.get-district-messages`
*   `res.message-service.api-gateway.post-district-message`

*Action:* Please **verify** that your Kafka consumer/listener logic (e.g., `@KafkaListener` annotations or manual consumer setup) is correctly configured to listen to these topics (potentially using a pattern like `res.*.api-gateway.*` or individual listeners) and handle incoming reply messages, correlating them using the `correlationId`.

**Summary:**

*   **Produce & Create:** Ensure `NewTopic` beans exist for all `req.api-gateway.*` topics you send messages to.
*   **Consume & Listen:** Ensure listeners are configured for all `res.*.api-gateway.*` reply topics you expect responses on.

This provides a complete picture of your service's Kafka interactions. Please confirm your configuration aligns with this summary.

Thanks!
